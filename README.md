Assembly final project

This is the final project for my assembly class, asteroids programmed in assembly(duh).
It was originally going to be like regular asteroids but last minute changes were made so you now play as an ace pilot bombing asteroids with homing missiles, racking up a huge score, with only a time limit to slow you down.
